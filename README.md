## notion-freehand

notion-freehand is an open-source deployable project for embedding drawings into your Notion documents.

### Usage

Since names are unique per domain, I suggest cloning and deploying to your platform of choice.

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/shannonrothe/notion-freehand.git
```

2. Deploy to a chosen platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc)

3. Embed into Notion with `/embed` and `https://your-url.com?name=<document-name>`
